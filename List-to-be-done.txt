## The main Aim is to collect all Algorithms
## First Basics
## After that others, It will be greate to get some Advanced/Different Data Structure and Algorithms


## Any Contributer can contribute if they think that a particular Algorithm is missing or should be included.
## For that plz create an issue first and then create a seperate Branch and atleast add a file explaining the Algorithm.

## Any Different Algorithm like Some Game solving algorithm are most welcom. For Example "Maze Solving Aldorithm".
