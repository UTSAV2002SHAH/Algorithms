# The main Aim is to collect all Algorithms
# First Basics
# After that others, It will be greate to get some Advanced/Different Data Structure and Algorithms


## <p>--> Any Contributer can contribute if they think that a particular Algorithm is missing or should be included.</p>
## --> For that plz create an issue first and then create a seperate Branch and atleast add a file explaining the Algorithm.

## --> Any Different Algorithm like Some Game solving algorithm are most welcom. For Example "Maze Solving Aldorithm".
